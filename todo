add searchbar in chatview

reusable popup dialog/menu overlay


about screen
error messages
debug menu


new chat screen
settings screen
profile view
login screen

edit chat screen

view for long messages

how do we make links in messages clickable?

small things:
- make chat messages view start on the bottom

bigger things:
QR code scanner view

register as share handler so other apps can share via deltachat
register urischeme to use delta-login for example
Localization (translations)
 - for that we could copy and adjust the translation system from desktop
add emoji picker - maybe also with tabs optimize it to work effiently for the user (a few keys to emoji as possible) + a search


interesting for oauth2 (google & yandex):
"redirects": [
        {
            "from": "http://localhost",
            "to": "/js/cards/oauth2/redirect.html"
        }
    ],


complementary side project - idea: 
have a companion static website
that you can put in your credentials and do the oauth2 thing
and then it gives you a qr code you can scan to login
