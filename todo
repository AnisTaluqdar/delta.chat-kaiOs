focus messages on keypresses (looks like tabbing through the elements isn't implemented in kai)

reusable popup dialog/menu overlay


about screen
error messages
debug menu

don't have the header and software key bar overlay the content,
 make the content in a content element that has overflow-y:scroll set


new chat screen
settings screen
profile view
login screen

edit chat screen


small things:
statusbar color
 - transparent statusbar, chrome in manifest isn't the right thing, it doesn't work -> ah it works, but only after restart.
 -> maybe also look at the code of https://github.com/kaiostech/sample-vanilla/blob/master/src/css/header.css  for styling the header
 - goal is to have the app look like its more part of the system like the other kaiOS apps.
add name of contact to chatview like in whatsapp.


bigger things:
QR code scanner view

register as share handler so other apps can share via deltachat
register urischeme to use delta-login for example
Localization (translations)


interesting for oauth2 (google & yandex):
"redirects": [
        {
            "from": "http://localhost",
            "to": "/js/cards/oauth2/redirect.html"
        }
    ],
